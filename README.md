# Verbasizer
A program intended to inspire song writers who have an idea for a song, but have only discovered a few applicable words before being stuck with writer's block.
The program will ask the user details regarding what ideas they have so far: such as nouns, verbs, words that rhyme, full phrases, etc.   
With this information, the program will shuffle the words randomly and then print out proper sentences according to English grammatical rules as best as it can.  
From there, the user will then interact with the program by purposefully shuffling certain words or statements around until the user is satisfied with the skeleton.  
Once the user is satisfied, the program will then transfer the text into a file so that later it may be accessed so that the user may continue their work in progress.  
Please note that this program pays homage to David Bowie and his original analog "cut-up technique" in which he would put possible lyrics in a hat, shake it up, and  
then pick them out and put them together and then rearrange them. Later, during the 90s, he coded this technique into what he called the "Verbasizer".   
Unfortunately, this program was not made available to the public, and since technology has changed so much since then, I felt, as a programmer and music enthusiast, 
that it would be a crime not to recreate and revamp it for the modern musician.

Currently I am studying more coding in my free time to implement this program with essential features like a GUI and machine learning.
